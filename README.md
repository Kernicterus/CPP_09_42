Develop a program to evaluate expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and compute the result.
- Exercise 02: Merge Insertion Sort:  
Implement the Fred-Johnson merge insertion sort algorithm to sort numbers in two different container types.

These exercises focus on data analysis, expression evaluation, and sorting algorithms.
